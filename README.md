## 🛠️ How to Edit Text in HTML

1. **Open Your HTML File**  
   Open the `.html` file you want to edit in a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VSCode, or any code editor).  

2. **Find the Text You Want to Change**  
   Look for content between `<tag>` and `</tag>` (e.g., `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`). The text you want to edit is between these tags.

3. **Make Your Changes**  
   For example changing text is shown here:
   
```html
<h1>Old Text</h1>

<h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
```
   
4. **Save the file (Ctrl + S or Cmd + S) and refresh your browser to see the changes.**
